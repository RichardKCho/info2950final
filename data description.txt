What are the observations (rows) and the attributes (columns)?Rows: pokemon namesColumns: usage percentWhy was this dataset created?This dataset was created to keep track of how often (in percentage) certain pokemon were used in competitive pokemon battles. The dataset was organized so that users could easily see which pokemon were overused (good), poor-used (bad), and in between.Who funded the creation of the dataset?Smogon, a competitive pokemon site featuring analyses, articles, and popular forums. They would want this dataset created in order to have more pokemon players use the website for their needs in competitive play.What processes might have influenced what data was observed and recorded and what was not? This particular dataset was trying to measure the frequency at which pokemon are used. Therefore, when the data was collected, it collected raw usage and percent usage, along with the pokemon names. Although pokemons’ stats and moves are largely relevant in competitive play, it was not directly used in collecting usage percentage, therefore it was not recorded.What preprocessing was done, and how did the data come to be in the form that you are using? First, pokemon in each tier that were used less than 0.00001% were eliminated, as they would be recorded as used 0.00000%. Additionally, all pokemon that were not in the original dataset or showed up more than once were removed.If people are involved, were they aware of the data collection and if so, what purpose did they expect the data to be used for? N/AWhere can your raw source data be found, if applicable?
